		<br><br><b>What is a temporary / disposable / anonymous mail?</b>
		<br>Disposable e-mail is a temporary and completely anonymous email address with a predetermined lifetime that does not require any registration.

		<br>To register on dubious sites, create and send anonymous correspondence. It is particularly useful for all situations in which your privacy is of paramount importance i.e. forums, sweepstakes, instant messaging.
